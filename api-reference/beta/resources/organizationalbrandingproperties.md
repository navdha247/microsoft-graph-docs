# organizationalBrandingProperties resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An abstract type that exposes properties for configuring an organization's branding.

Organizations can customize their Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign-in pages which appear when users sign in to their organization's tenant-specific apps, or when Azure AD identifies the user's tenant from their username. A developer can also read the company's branding information and customize their app experience to tailor it specifically for the signed-in user using their company's branding.

You can't change your original configuration's language. However, companies can add different branding based on locale. For language-specific branding, see the [organizationalBrandingLocalization](organizationalbrandinglocalization.md) object.

>[!NOTE]
>Adding custom branding requires you to have either Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium 1, Premium 2, or Office 365 (for Office 365 apps) licenses. For more information about licensing and editions, see [Sign up for Azure AD Premium](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-get-started-premium).
>
>Azure AD Premium editions are available for customers in China using the worldwide instance of Azure Active Directory. Azure AD Premium editions aren't currently supported in the Azure service operated by 21Vianet in China. For more information, talk to us using the [Azure Active Directory Forum](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory/).
